# FastAPI

List of three FastAPI projects for beginners, intermediate, and expert level developers

## Beginners

**Weather Forecast API**
   - Description - Create an API that provides weather forecasts based on user input (e.g., city name or ZIP code).
   - Features
     - Integration with a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
     - Endpoint for retrieving current weather conditions.
     - Endpoint for fetching hourly or daily forecasts.
     - Input validation and error handling.

## Intermediate

**User Authentication and Authorization API**

   - Features
     - Endpoints for user registration, login, and password reset.
     - JWT token generation and validation.
     - Role-based access control (RBAC) with different permission levels.
     - Secure password storage using hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).

## Expert

**IoT (Internet of Things) API**
   - Description - Build an API for interacting with IoT devices such as sensors, actuators, and smart appliances.
   - Features
     - Endpoints for device registration, data retrieval, and control commands.
     - Support for various IoT protocols (e.g., MQTT, CoAP).
