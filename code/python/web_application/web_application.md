# Web Application

Web Application development in Python using Flask, FastAPI, and Django.

## [Flask](flask/flask.md)
Flask is a lightweight and flexible micro-framework for web development in Python. It provides the essentials for building web applications without imposing rigid patterns or dependencies. Flask is ideal for small to medium-sized projects, RESTful APIs, and prototyping.

**Features**
- Simple and easy-to-use API.
- Lightweight and minimalistic design.
- Extensible through a wide range of extensions.
- Built-in development server and debugger.

## [FastAPI](fastapi/fastapi.md)
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use, efficient, and scalable, making it suitable for building high-performance APIs and web applications.

- Dependency injection system for organizing code.
- Built-in support for WebSocket endpoints.

## [Django](django/django.md)
Django is a high-level, full-stack web framework for building robust and scalable web applications. It follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, providing built-in features for authentication, ORM, URL routing, templating, and more. Django is suitable for large-scale projects and follows a convention over configuration approach.

- **Official Website** [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- **Documentation** [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/)

**Features**
- Comprehensive admin interface.
- Object-relational mapping (ORM) for database interactions.
- URL routing and request handling.
