# Tool

Network simulation tools are invaluable for network engineers and administrators to design, analyze, and troubleshoot computer networks in a virtual environment.

## 1. Cisco Packet Tracer:
- Developed by Cisco Systems, Packet Tracer is a comprehensive network simulation tool used for teaching and learning networking concepts.
- It allows users to create network topologies, configure devices (routers, switches, PCs, etc.), and simulate network behavior.
- Packet Tracer supports a wide range of Cisco devices and protocols, making it ideal for CCNA and CCNP certification training.

## 2. GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator-3):
- GNS3 is an open-source network simulation platform that allows users to create complex network topologies using real Cisco images.
- It supports both Cisco and non-Cisco devices and can run actual router and switch IOS images for more accurate simulations.
- GNS3 provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for topology design and configuration and integrates with virtualization technologies like VMware and VirtualBox.

## 3. EVE-NG (Emulated Virtual Environment - Next Generation):
- EVE-NG is a network emulation platform that enables users to create virtual network topologies using real network images.
- It supports a wide range of network vendors, including Cisco, Juniper, Arista, and more.
- EVE-NG provides a web-based interface for topology design, configuration, and management.

## 4. Wireshark:
- While primarily a packet analyzer, Wireshark can also be used for network simulation and troubleshooting.
- It allows users to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time, making it useful for diagnosing network issues and simulating network behavior.
- Wireshark supports a wide range of protocols and can be used to generate and analyze simulated network traffic.

## 5. Boson NetSim:
- Boson NetSim is a network simulation tool designed for certification training and network education.
- It provides a virtual environment for practicing networking concepts and configurations, with support for a variety of network devices and protocols.
- NetSim includes guided labs and tutorials to help users learn networking concepts and prepare for certification exams.

These network simulation tools offer diverse features and capabilities, allowing network professionals to design, test, and troubleshoot networks efficiently in a simulated environment before deploying changes in a production network.
