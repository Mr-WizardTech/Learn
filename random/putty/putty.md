# PuTTY

PuTTY is a free and open-source terminal emulator, serial console, and network file transfer application. It supports various network protocols, including SSH, Telnet, rlogin, and raw socket 
connection. 

PuTTY is commonly used to remotely control servers via SSH.

## Installation

### Windows

1. **Download PuTTY**: Go to the [PuTTY download page](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) and download the `putty.exe` file.
2. **Run the Installer**: Double-click the downloaded `putty.exe` file to run PuTTY without needing to install it.

### macOS

PuTTY can be installed using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install putty
```

### Linux

PuTTY can be installed via the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install putty
```

## Use Case

PuTTY is primarily used for establishing secure connections to remote servers. Here's a common use case:

1. **Launching PuTTY** Open PuTTY from your applications menu or run the `putty` command in your terminal if installed via a package manager.
   
2. **Configuring the Connection**
   - **Host Name** Enter the IP address or hostname of the server you want to connect to.
   - **Port** Enter the port number, usually `22` for SSH.
   - **Connection Type** Select SSH.

3. **Saving the Session** (optional) You can save the session configuration for future use by entering a name in the 'Saved Sessions' field and clicking 'Save'.

4. **Connecting** Click 'Open' to initiate the connection. If this is the first time connecting to the server, you'll see a security alert about the server's host key. Accept it to proceed.

5. **Logging In** When prompted, enter your username and password to log into the remote server.

### Additional Features

- **SSH Keys** For more secure authentication, you can use SSH keys instead of passwords. Generate a key pair using `ssh-keygen` and configure PuTTY to use your private key.

- **Port Forwarding** PuTTY supports port forwarding, allowing you to tunnel other network connections through your SSH connection.

- **Customization** You can customize the appearance and behavior of your terminal window, including font size, colors, and window size.

PuTTY is a tool for remote server management, offering robust features for secure and customizable connections. Whether you're a system administrator or a developer, PuTTY provides a reliable way to access and manage your servers.
