## Real-Time Tasks

### [Task 1](task1.md)
You need to automate the process of backing up important files on your system every day.

### Solution:
Write a Bash script that uses `tar` to create a compressed archive of the files and `cron` to schedule the script to run daily.

### [Task 2](task2.md)
You want to create a script that automatically updates the software packages on your system.

### Solution:
Write a Bash script that uses package manager commands like `apt-get` or `yum` to update the system packages.

### [Task 3](task3.md)
You want to automate the process of generating daily reports with the current date.

### Solution:
Create a Bash script that uses the `date` command to get the current date and saves it to a variable, then use that variable to generate the report filename.

### [Task 4](task4.md)
You frequently need to convert text files from one format to another.

### Solution:
Write a Bash script with a function that takes a filename as an argument and converts it to the desired format using appropriate commands like `awk`, `sed`, or `grep`.

### [Task 5](task5.md)
You want to create a script that checks if a specific directory exists and performs different actions based on the result.

### Solution:
Use an `if` statement in your script to check for the existence of the directory using the `test` command (`[ -d "$directory" ]`) and execute different commands based on the result.

### [Task 6](task6.md)
You have a directory with multiple files, and you want to perform the same operation on each file.

### Solution:
Write a Bash script with a `for` loop that iterates over each file in the directory and executes the desired operation.

### [Task 7](task7.md)
You need to find and delete all log files older than a certain date.

### Solution:
Write a Bash script that uses `find` to locate files matching the criteria and `rm` to delete them.

### [Task 8](task8.md)
You have a CSV file with data in the format "name,age,email" and you want to extract only the email addresses.

### Solution:
Write a Bash script that uses `cut` or `awk` to extract the email addresses from each line of the file.

### [Task 9](task9.md)
You want to write a script that automatically sends an email notification when a certain condition is met.

### Solution:
Use command substitution to capture the output of a command that checks the condition, then use the captured value to send an email using `mail` or `sendmail`.

### [Task 10](task10.md)
You have a script that runs commands with potential errors, and you want to handle these errors gracefully.

### Solution:
Implement error handling in your script using constructs like `if` statements to check the exit status of commands (`$?`) and `&&` or `||` operators for conditional execution based on success or failure.

tackling real-time Tasks and using Bash scripting to automate tasks and solve challenges in the Linux environment, you'll develop practical skills that are valuable for system administration, development, and everyday productivity.
