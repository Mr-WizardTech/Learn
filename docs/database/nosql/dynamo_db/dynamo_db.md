## No Prerequisites

DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS, so there are no prerequisites. However, to interact with DynamoDB, you'll need an AWS account and access to the AWS Management Console or AWS SDK.

## No Installation

Since DynamoDB is a fully managed service provided by AWS, there's no need to install it locally. You can access DynamoDB through the AWS Management Console or programmatically using the AWS SDKs.

## How to Connect with Application

To connect with DynamoDB from your application, you'll need to use the AWS SDKs for your programming language. Here's how you can connect using Python, Node.js, and Ruby:

### Connecting with Python

You can connect to DynamoDB from Python using the `boto3` library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here's a basic example:

```python
import boto3

# Create DynamoDB client
dynamodb = boto3.client('dynamodb')

# Example: List tables
response = dynamodb.list_tables()

# Print table names
for table in response['TableNames']:
    print(table)
```

### Connecting with Node.js

You can connect to DynamoDB from Node.js using the `aws-sdk` library. Here's a basic example:

```javascript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');

// Configure AWS SDK
AWS.config.update({
  region: 'your_region',
  accessKeyId: 'your_access_key_id',
  secretAccessKey: 'your_secret_access_key'
});

// Create DynamoDB client
const dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB();

// Example: List tables
dynamodb.listTables({}, (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log(data.TableNames);
  }
});
```

### Connecting with Ruby

You can connect to DynamoDB from Ruby using the `aws-sdk-dynamodb` gem. Here's a basic example:

```ruby
require 'aws-sdk-dynamodb'

# Configure AWS SDK
Aws.config.update({
  region: 'your_region',
  access_key_id: 'your_access_key_id',
  secret_access_key: 'your_secret_access_key'
})

# Create DynamoDB client
ddb = Aws::DynamoDB::Client.new

# Example: List tables
resp = ddb.list_tables

# Print table names
resp.table_names.each do |table_name|
  puts table_name
end
```

DynamoDB being a cloud-based NoSQL database service provided by AWS, requires appropriate credentials for access and usage operates on a pay-as-you-go pricing model, where you are charged based on the resources you consume and the operations you perform.
