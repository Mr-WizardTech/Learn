## Database

A database is an organized collection of structured data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. It is designed to efficiently manage, retrieve, and manipulate data according to the needs of the users or applications. Databases are fundamental components of modern information systems, enabling data storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion through standardized query languages and interfaces.

## Need of Database

- Databases are essential in various applications, from business management systems, e-commerce platforms, and social media services to scientific research and data analysis. 
- They ensure data integrity, security, and accessibility, supporting the robust and reliable operation of software systems.

## Types of Databases

Databases can be broadly classified into two main types based on their structure and query language

| Database Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
|[SQL](sql/sql.md) | SQL (Structured Query Language) databases use a relational model, which organizes data into tables with predefined schemas. They are known for their ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensure reliable transactions and data integrity. SQL databases are widely used in applications where complex queries and transactional consistency are crucial. |
| [NoSQL](nosql/nosql.md) | NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data. They provide flexible schemas and are optimized for horizontal scalability and performance. NoSQL databases are often used in big data and real-time web applications, where the data structure can evolve over time, and quick access is essential. |
