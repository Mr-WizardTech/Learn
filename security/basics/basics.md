# Basics of Security

Security is a critical aspect of any system, organization, or personal setup. Understanding the fundamentals of security helps in protecting assets, data, and ensuring privacy.

## 1. **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)**

The CIA triad is the core model used to guide policies for information security within an organization. It consists of three main components

- **Confidentiality** - Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
- **Integrity** - Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data.
- **Availability** - Ensuring that information and resources are available to those who need them when they need them.

## 2. **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)**

These are three key concepts in the management of security

- **Authentication** - Verifying the identity of a user or system.
- **Authorization** - Determining whether a user has permission to access a resource.
- **Accounting** - Keeping track of the actions of users and systems to ensure compliance and detect anomalies.

## 3. **Security Threats, Vulnerabilities and Risk**

Understanding the different types of threats and vulnerabilities is essential for effective security management

- **Threats** - Potential dangers that can exploit vulnerabilities to cause harm (e.g., malware, phishing, social engineering).
- **Vulnerabilities** - Weaknesses or gaps in a security program that can be exploited by threats (e.g., software bugs, misconfigurations).
- **Risk** - A risk is the potential for loss when the threat happens.

## 4. **Types of Security Controls**

Security controls are measures put in place to reduce or mitigate security risks. They can be categorized as follows

- **Preventive Controls** - Aim to prevent security incidents (e.g., firewalls, anti-virus software).
- **Detective Controls** - Aim to detect security incidents as they occur (e.g., intrusion detection systems, log monitoring).
- **Corrective Controls** - Aim to correct the impact of a security incident (e.g., backups, patch management).

## 5. **Types of Security**

Security encompasses various domains, each focusing on different aspects of protection. Here are some key types of security

- **Information Security**
   - Protects information from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction.

- **Cybersecurity** 
   - Focuses on protecting computer systems, networks, and data from cyber attacks.

- **Network Security**
   - Involves measures to secure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of networks and data during their transmission.

- **Application Security** 
   - Ensures that software applications are protected from threats throughout their lifecycle, including development, deployment, and maintenance.

- **Physical Security**
   - Involves protecting physical assets, such as buildings, hardware, and other tangible objects, from threats like theft, vandalism, and natural disasters.

- **Operational Security (OPSEC)**
   - Protects the daily operations of an organization, ensuring that sensitive information is kept secure and processes are not disrupted.

- **End-User Security**
   - Focuses on protecting the end-users' devices and personal data from threats, emphasizing the importance of user awareness and training.

- **Cloud Security**
   - Addresses the security measures required to protect data, applications, and services hosted in cloud environments.

- **Mobile Security**
   - Ensures that mobile devices, applications, and networks are protected from security threats.

Security is a multifaceted discipline that requires a comprehensive understanding of various principles, practices, and technologies. By adhering to these basics and leveraging established frameworks and best practices, individuals and organizations can better protect their assets and data from potential threats.
